## .NET Framework

- same old {% include fragment.md %}
- a lot of windows specific stuff {% include fragment.md %}
- ...but it's windows-only (I know, it's surprising) {% include fragment.md %}

Note:

Examples of windows specific:

- registry
- WMI - Windows Management Instrumentation
- WPF
- WinForms
- Windows Services
